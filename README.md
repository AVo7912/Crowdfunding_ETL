# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

Purpose:
To transform data in two excel files and create four different dataframes of data from the two files.  From those dataframes, create a csv file that can be imported into a database for storage.  Use the csv files to create a table schema of the date to be imported into a sql database.

Assignments:
We split the project up into three sections with each individual working on different parts of the project.  Aline worked on the dataframes, data clean-up, and the csv files for Category, Subcategory, and Contacts DF.  Annie worked on the dataframe, data clean-up and csv file for the Campaign DF.  Brian worked on creating the database schema, Crowdfunding database and importing the data from teh csv files.

End results:
1. Category table imported 9 records ;
2. Subcategory table imported 24 records ;
3. Contacts table imported 1000 records ;
4. Campaign table imported 1000 records
